Ever since I was a little kid, I've loved coding. From the moment of writing my first program in Python and manipulating it to produce the desired output, I have been obsessed with the idea of writing software to solve practical problems. Programming is like a never-ending puzzle where you continuously have to come up with a new way to solve it.

Outside of my job, I run a small business with a couple of friends where we develop drone shows. I'm responsible for both designing and writing the control software as well as creating and designing the actual drones.

When I get home after work/school, I tend to either continue writing code for some personal side-projects, or play around with cyber-security related stuff. This is what keeps me up at night, a never-ending thirst to create beautiful, powerful things and share them with the world.

Skills/Interests: Python, Java, Scala, JavaScript, Node, CSS, HTML, Git, SQL, MongoDB, Apache, Nginx, Docker.
