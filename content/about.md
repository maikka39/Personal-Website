Hey there, my name is Maik de Kruif, I create websites, bots and other kinds of software. At the moment, I'm still studying computer science at Avans University of Applied Sciences. I am also a big fan of open-source software, which is why you'll find many of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/maikka39). And last but not least, I love playing around with cyber-security related stuff.
