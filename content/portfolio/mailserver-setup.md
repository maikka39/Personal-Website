A script that automates the grueling process of installing and setting up an email server. It perfectly reproduces my successful steps to ensure the same setup time and time again, now with many improvements.

MailServerSetup ensures a consistent and efficient deployment. It leverages Postfix, Dovecot, and SpamAssassin, providing an all-round email solution.

Simply specify your desired domain, and the script will handle the setup, including generating the necessary SPF, DMARC, and DKIM records and providing them to you.
