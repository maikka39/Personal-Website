Google Foobar is a mysterious coding challenge platform launched by Google. It's designed to identify exceptional engineering talent through a series of progressively difficult coding problems. The platform's unique approach involves inviting users to solve challenges directly via the Google Search page, adding an element of intrigue and surprise.

I was fortunate enough to receive an invitation to Google Foobar. The initial challenge was a simple warm-up, but subsequent levels escalated in complexity, requiring me to delve into various algorithms and data structures.

Throughout my journey, I faced a diverse range of problems, from graph traversal and dynamic programming to string manipulation and number theory. Each challenge presented a unique opportunity to test my problem-solving skills and explore new coding techniques.

With dedication and perseverance, I managed to successfully solve all the challenges presented by Google Foobar. It was a rewarding experience that allowed me to showcase my coding abilities and learn new maths concepts.

~~If you're a passionate coder looking for a stimulating challenge, Google Foobar is definitely worth exploring. It's a great way to test your skills, learn new concepts, and potentially open doors to exciting opportunities.~~ Unfortunately, Google shut down the platform, and the challenges are no longer available. You can still try them by taking a look at the challenge texts in my GitHub repo, by clicking the link at the top of this post.
