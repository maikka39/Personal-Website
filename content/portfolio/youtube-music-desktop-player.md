YouTube Music Desktop Player converts YouTube Music to a standalone desktop app. Because of this, you will never have to go through all your tabs to control your music.

Before Google released their official YouTube Music desktop app, I created my own using Electron. I used script injection to add custom features like buttons, media key control, Discord rich presence, and custom styling. Additionally, I implemented [MPRIS](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/) support for integration with desktop environments.

This project was a valuable learning experience, as it allowed me to explore the capabilities of Electron and deepen my understanding of web technologies and desktop app development. It also gave me the opportunity to solve real-world problems and create a tool that enhanced the YouTube Music experience.
