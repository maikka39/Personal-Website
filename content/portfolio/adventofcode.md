[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a popular annual programming event that presents a series of coding puzzles, one for each day of December until Christmas. Each puzzle involves solving a problem using a programming language of your choice, with (generally) increasing difficulty as the event progresses.

I actively participate in Advent of Code, relishing the daily challenges and the opportunity to sharpen my coding skills. The puzzles covered a wide range of topics, from string manipulation and data structures to algorithms and game theory.

By consistently solving the puzzles, I hone my problem-solving abilities, improve my understanding of different programming paradigms, and discover new and innovative approaches to coding challenges.
