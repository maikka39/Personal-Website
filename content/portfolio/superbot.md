An amazing Discord bot with lots of functionalities!

SuperBot is a Discord bot I wrote for my own server so that I could manage the server better and listen to music together in voice channels.

I developed SuperBot using Python. Through this project, I gained experience in Discord bot development, including API interactions, event handling, and user interface design. Additionally, I learned valuable lessons in error handling, optimization, and scalability.
