Neural Network Python library for experimenting with Machine Learning.

Based on the amazing work done by [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman) at [TheCodingTrain](https://thecodingtrain.com/), I built my own Neural Network library in Python. I used [Chapter 10: Neural Networks](https://natureofcode.com/neural-networks/) of his Nature of Code book as a reference.

Building this library was a very valuable learning experience. Itâ€™s helped me grasp the underlying principles of these models, from basic neuron structures to more complex algorithms like backpropagation.
